# Project_Gurgaon

This project predicts housing prices in Gurgaon using a trained Machine Learning model.  
It includes data preprocessing, model training, a saved pipeline, and scripts to generate predictions from input Excel files.  
Part of my practical Data Science learning journey using Python and Scikit-Learn.
