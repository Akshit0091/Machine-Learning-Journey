# 🌸 IRIS Classification — Machine Learning Project

This project is part of my Machine Learning journey, where I implemented a classification model on the famous **Iris Flower Dataset** to predict flower species based on their features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width).

## 📊 Key Steps
- Data preprocessing and splitting into train/test sets  
- Model training using supervised learning algorithms  
- Accuracy evaluation and performance comparison  

## 🧠 Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- K-Nearest Neighbors  

## 📈 Results
Achieved over **95% accuracy** on the test dataset.

## 📁 Files Included
- `IRIS_MODEL.ipynb` – Model training and testing  
- `accuracy_on_iris.ipynb` – Accuracy and evaluation  
- `iris-train.xlsx` / `iris-test.xlsx` – Dataset files
